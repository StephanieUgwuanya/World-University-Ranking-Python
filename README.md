<h1>World-University-Ranking-Python</h1>

This analysis focuses on global university ranking data, exploring not only the overall rankings of universities worldwide but also their standings within individual countries.

In addition, the dataset examines several key factors, including the quality of education, alumni employment rank, faculty quality, publication rank, influence rank, and the number of students at each university. 


<h1>Key Questions & Objectives</h1>

Universities continually aim to improve their rankings to elevate their reputation and prestige. A higher rank not only enhances global recognition but also increases access to funding, which can be reinvested in upgrading facilities and advancing the institution’s mission. This analysis was designed to assist university administrators and leadership in strategically allocating resources to strengthen their global standing.

The hypothesis explored in this project:

<b>Universities that invest more in R&D have a higher overall ranking across the world.</b>

<h1>Data & Tools</h1>

The dataset, sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings/data">Kaggle</a>, is based on external data from the following reliable sources, likely gathered through surveys, research metrics, and statistical analyses:

•	The Times Higher Education World University Ranking, founded in the UK in 2010, is widely regarded as one of the most influential and closely watched university ranking systems.

•	The Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking), established in China in 2003, holds similar global influence in university evaluation.

•	The Centre for World University Rankings, a lesser-known listing from Saudi Arabia, was founded in 2012 and provides another valuable perspective on university rankings.

These rankings provide a comprehensive and credible look at university performance across various dimensions.
