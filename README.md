<h1>World-University-Ranking-Python</h1>

This analysis focuses on global university ranking data, exploring not only the overall rankings of universities worldwide but also their standings within individual countries.

In addition, the dataset examines several key factors, including the quality of education, alumni employment rank, faculty quality, publication rank, influence rank, and the number of students at each university. 

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is based on external data from the following reliable sources, likely gathered through surveys, research metrics, and statistical analyses:

•	The Times Higher Education World University Ranking, founded in the UK in 2010, is widely regarded as one of the most influential and closely watched university ranking systems.

•	The Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking), established in China in 2003, holds similar global influence in university evaluation.

•	The Centre for World University Rankings, a lesser-known listing from Saudi Arabia, was founded in 2012 and provides another valuable perspective on university rankings.

These rankings provide a comprehensive and credible look at university performance across various dimensions.
